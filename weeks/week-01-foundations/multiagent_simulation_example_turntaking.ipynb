            "🗣️ Member_1: Co-sign across the board. Let’s make “The Long Game” tangible with one hero device: the Wear Counter. Every piece has an NFC tally that updates a live $/wear ticker—mirrored on OOH near Class‑A corridors and lounges. Pair with a dated Durability Index mark (lab score + test date) on all assets. Turn the receipt into a Proof Ticket in creative: a minimal card that shows $/wear dropping over time. Keep headlines whisper‑quiet: “Proof has a number.” and “10 years. 1 jacket. $2.38 a wear.” with a subtle repair stitch Easter egg in the corner.\n",

            "Adds: Patina Portraits (credible pros photographed at 100/250/500 wears) and “Evidence Booths” in lobbies/airport lounges where scans print an embossed CPW card. Time‑reveal OOH that ages into the message (scuffable, sun‑fade, rain‑ink) to dramatize durability. Launch the 10‑Year Jacket Challenge: hit 300 wears or trigger buyback/Handoff Mode; first repair free token to nudge early engagement. For ABM, give CFO/CHRO a team Proof Portal (Slack/Okta SSO) with CPW scoreboard + depreciation/ESG download. North‑Star KPI stays Verified Wear Events; secondary: CPW calculator completions, Repair Concierge conversion, and “time to first 100 wears.”\n",

            "🗣️ Member_3: Big yes to “The Long Game” and the quiet math. To keep it credible and human, make the Wear Counter strictly opt-in/anonymous with aggregate displays only, and pair CPW with two simple proof points: repairs performed and resources saved per 100 wears (CO2e/water/plastic diverted), third‑party audited. Love the Durability Index—add a Material Provenance seal (GRS % recycled, traceability date) so it’s not just endurance but source. Evidence Booths: prioritize on‑site mending and digital wallet passes; embossed cards optional and recycled, to avoid “proof waste.” Keep OOH low‑impact—reclaimed substrates, waterless inks, designed for post-campaign reuse.\n",

For ABM, frame a Scope 3 wardrobe pilot with CFO/CHRO: CPW scoreboard + depreciation, uniform/benefit policy toolkit, and ESG download.

Make the Care & Proof Passport the center of gravity (Apple/Google Wallet, opt‑in only) and launch a 90‑Day Wear ROI Challenge with first repair credit and Handoff Mode bonus to catalyze logging.
